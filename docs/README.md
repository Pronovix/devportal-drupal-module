This module comes with a Docker based development/testing environment that you can find in the `.dev` folder.

Using this pre-made environment for development is not mandatory but it is highly recommended, because this
environment is used by the CI to run this module's tests.

### Requirements

- [Docker >= 18.03](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
