## Managing landing pages

 developer portal uses the paragraph toolkit to create landing pages. Content creators can use the toolkit to build sophisticated, tailor made pages in a couple of hours without the help from developers or site builders.

Paragraphs are landing page building elements with a set of adjustable features such as title, description, picture, or background color. When you build a landing page with the paragraph toolkit, you can set up the paragraphs individually without coding skills.

###Â Creating a new landing page

You can create a new landing page type content item by following the steps below, or edit an existing one by only editing some of the fields.

1. In the administrative menu, go to _Content_.

2. Click on _Add content_, then click on _Landing page_.

3. Fill in the form fields where needed. See the table for fields and values below.

   Required fields are marked with a red .

## Creating API reference

You can create API reference content items in two ways:

* __Uploading an API reference file__: choose this method when you have an API reference documentation source file that you can upload.

* __Fill in values manually__: choose this method when you donâ€™t have an API reference documentation source file yet, but you want to expose some information about the API (e.g.: the API is in the design phase).

To create an API Reference content item that will be displayed on the user interface, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to _Content_ > _Add content_ > _API Reference_.

2. Choose upload mode by using the _Mode_ selector. You have two options:

      a. _Upload an API reference file_ â€“ select this option if you want to upload an API reference file. See [Upload an API reference file](#uploading-an-api-reference-file) section for further instructions.

      b. _Fill in the values manually_ â€“ select this option if you want to upload an API reference file later. See [Fill in the values manually](#filling-in-the-values-manually) section for further instructions.

### Uploading an API reference file

After you selected the _Upload an API reference file_ option, follow these steps:

1. Upload the _Source file_ by clicking on _Choose file_ and locating the source file on your computer. The source file is a Swagger/OpenAPI JSON/YAML/YML file. The system will validate the file and display the result:

    a. If the source file is not valid, it displays a meaningful error message that informs you about the nature of the error.

    b. If the source file is valid, it loads the source file. A _Remove_ button appears.

2. Check the _Published_ checkbox if you want to publish the API Reference. Published content items will be available on the portal for users with the right permission.

3. _Save_.

![Upload an API reference file](@guide_path/Assets/6_sourcefile.jpg)

### Filling in the values manually

After you selected the _Fill in the values manually_ option, follow these steps:

1. Add a _Title_ to the API reference content item.

2. Add a description about the API to the _Description_ field.

3. Add a version number to the _Version_ field.

4. Check the _Published_ checkbox if you want to publish the API reference content item. Published content items will be available on the portal for users with the right permission.

5. _Save_.

![Fill in the values manually](@guide_path/Assets/7_apireference.jpg)

Now you created an API Reference content item that works as a placeholder as there is no source file attached. When you upload a source file to this API Reference content item, the title, the description, and the version number in the source file you upload will override the data that you provided manually. __After there is a source file uploaded, you are no longer able to provide data manually.__

## Creating an API bundle page

You can publish information about the API services that the  Developer Portal offers through the API bundle pages. The summary of the API bundle will appear on the Service page as an item of the service list.

You can create an API bundle page by following the steps below:

1. In the administrative menu, navigate to _Content_ > _Add content_ > _API bundle_.

2. Add a _Title_ to the API bundle.

3. Choose the appropriate _Domain_ to the API bundle. The API bundle you about to create will associated with the domain you choose here.

4. Assign the appropriate API reference(s) to the API bundle. The API reference(s) you choose here will be associated with the API bundle. You can add more API reference to the API bundle by clicking on _Add another item_.

5. Add a _Summary_ to the API bundle. The copy you provide here will appear on the _Services_ page where the services are listed.

    ![API bundle page form â€“ first part](@guide_path/Assets/8_apibundle1.jpg)

6. Add your copy to the _Text_ field and edit it. The text you provide here will be displayed in the header of the API bundle page.

7. Upload a _Background image_. Click _Choose file_, locate the image on your computer, the system will upload the image and a thumbnail will appear. Click _Remove_ if you want to remove the image. Add alternative text to the image. The image will be displayed in the header of the API bundle page.

8. Add _Landing page elements_ to the API bundle page. See the [Paragraph Types](#paragraph-types) section for the available paragraph types and more details.

9. Check the _Published_ checkbox if you want to publish the page after saving. Leave it unchecked if you don't want to publish yet.

10. _Save_.

    ![API bundle page form â€“ second part](@guide_path/Assets/9_apibundle2.jpg)

## Creating an API documentation page

 developer portal uses the Drupal Book module to manage API documentation pages and bundle together pages that related to each other.

To create an API documentation page, follow the steps below.

1. In the administrative menu, go to _Content_ > _Add content_ > _Book page_.

2. Add a _Title_ to the documentation page.

3. Add the piece of documentation to the _Body_ field. You can choose different text formats ( style, Basic HTML, Restricted HTML, Full HTML, GitHub Flavored Markdown) from the drop-down menu.

4. Check the _Published_ checkbox if you want to publish the page after saving. Leave it unchecked if you don't want to publish yet.

5. Add the documentation page to a book in the _Book outline_ section of the content settings menu on the right side of the page. Use the drop-down menu under the _Book_ section to select the book you want to assign the documentation page to. You can add the documentation page to a parent item of the book (subsection) by using the _Parent item_ selector. Choose the _Create a new book_ option if you want to add the page to a new book.

6. _Save_.

![Creating an API documentation page](@guide_path/Assets/10_apidoc.jpg)

__!NOTE__: The API documentation page you created will appear in the selected book.

## Handling header background

 developer portal provides the possibility to display the same header background image on multiple pages without the need to upload the same file repeatedly. You can define a URL pattern and assign it to a header background image. The image will be displayed all the pages that match the URL pattern you defined.

### Uploading header background and defining URL pattern

To upload a header background and define a URL pattern, follow the steps below:

1. In the administrative menu, go to _Structure_ > _Header Background Settings_. The _Header Background List_ page opens, you can check, edit, or delete the existing URL definitions and background images in the list.

2. Click _Add Header Background_ at the top of the page.

3. Upload a _Background image_. Click _Choose file_, locate the image on your computer, the system will upload the image and a thumbnail will appear. Click _Remove_ if you want to remove the image. Add alternative text to the image.

4. Define a URL pattern in the _URL pattern_ field. You don't have to add the site domain name. You can use asterisk (\*) as a wildcard character which stands for any string of characters. For example if you want to use the uploaded image on all the pages that are under /services (e.g.: /services/api1, /services/api2, etc.), then define /services/* as a URL pattern. The wildcard character will stand for any path segment that follows /services.

5. _Save_.

## User handling

Regarding user handling, the  developer portal does not have any custom feature compared to the default user management in Drupal 8.

See the Drupal 8 user guide about [user account management](https://www.drupal.org/docs/guides/en/user-chapter.html).
